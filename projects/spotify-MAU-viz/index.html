                                href="https://public.tableau.com/views/SpotifyMAUAnalysis/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link">Click

                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Research Question and Data Overview</strong></p>

                        <p>The inspiration for this data exploration came from a dataset that I found on Kaggle, titled
                            <a
                                href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mauryansshivam/spotify-revenue-expenses-and-its-premium-users">Spotify
                                Revenue, Expenses and Its Premium Users</a>.
                            This dataset focuses on the cost, revenue, and active user numbers for Spotify's two user
                            types, ad-based (free) and premium (All numbers from the graphs are in Euro millions). I decided that I would test my knowledge of Tableau and
                            see if I could find some intereseting patterns about these numbers.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Activity Differences Between Free and Premium Users</strong></p>

                        <p>To start, I was curious about the activity differences between the user types in terms of MAU,
                            which tracks users that have played music for more than 0 milliseconds in the past
                            30 days. Although there is no sign-up data for new accounts available, I imagine that this data would
                            match the MAU trends pretty closely. I noticed that premium users have had an almost boring,
                            near-perfect linear growth since 2016. Ad-based users, however, have been increasing at a
                            noticably higher percentage over the past 2 quarters (Q4 2022 and Q1 2023). This is the
                            first time that ad-based users have increased by over 20 million users in a quarter, and it
                            has done so twice in a row now.</p>

                        <figure><img
                                src="https://andrewkirrane.github.io/Portfolio/image/spotify-MAU-viz/MAU-by-user-type.png" />
                        </figure>

                        <p>Obviously this got me asking one question: <strong>Why would there be a noticable
                                increase?</strong> I
                            kept looking through the available data until I found some of Spotify's expense numbers,
                            specifically looking at the difference in their spending between marketing and R&D.</p>

                        <figure><img
                                src="https://andrewkirrane.github.io/Portfolio/image/spotify-MAU-viz/spending-patterns.png" />
                        </figure>

                        <p>As you can see, Spotify has drastically reduced their marketing and sales spending since the
                            end of last year and have let that take a backseat to their R&D spending. This could
                            definitely be partially influenced by the AI boom, but it is interesting none the less. In order to make
                            sure that the increased spending was actually making differences in their platform, I did
                            some research on their application update history. Spotify has an interesting approach to
                            their update logs, and by that I mean that they don't tell users anything about app changes.
                            The same <i>We’re always making changes and improvements to Spotify. To make sure you don’t
                                miss a thing, just keep your Updates turned on</i> tag is the only public information available. I'm
                            gonna give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are making feature
                            improvements in these updates and not just removing existing bugs. The data that I could
                            track was in the form of update frequency. I found that between the beginning of 2022 (the
                            big uptick in R&D spending) and the end of Q1 2023, Spotify had updated their app 65 times.
                            In the previous year, 2021, they only updated their app 46 times (<a
                                href="https://www.ipa4fun.com/history/1060/">Source</a>). Broken down by quarter, they
                            have increased the number of updates from 11.5 to 13, which most likely means an increase in the amount
                            of new content and features.</p>

                        <p>This is pretty good so far, but a bizarre question popped up once I looked at their ad
                            revenue for Q1 2023. I fully expected the ad revenue to match the same uptick as the
                            ad-based MAU chart showed, but to my surprise I found a pretty steep drop off.</p>

                        <figure><img
                                src="https://andrewkirrane.github.io/Portfolio/image/spotify-MAU-viz/ad-revenue.png" />
                        </figure>

                        <p><strong>Fun Experiment Time</strong></p>

                        <p>I brainstormed a little bit on why the ad-based MAU increase could correlate with a steep
                            decrease in ad revenue for Spotify. My first thought was to see if they lowered their ad
                            prices to allow for smaller businesses to use this service, but their pricing structure
                            hasn't changed since at least 2021 (<a href="https://ads.spotify.com/">Current Pricing</a>
                            and <a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/spotify-ads-cost/#toc-0">Pricing in
                                2021</a>). My other thought was that there was a change to Spotify's ad-based platform
                            that made it less incentivising for advertisers. <strong>Could Spotify have changed the
                                platform to play less ads for free users?</strong> I absolutely had to know. I did some
                            more research and found multiple reports from 2022, in which ad-based users stated that they
                            got ad breaks between every 2-3 songs (<a
                                href="https://allthingsdigitaladvertising.com/why-am-i-getting-ads-after-every-song-on-spotify/#:~:text=ad%2Dfree%20Spotify%3F-,When%20does%20Spotify%20play%20ads%3F,listening%20to%20ad%2Dsupported%20Spotify.">Source</a>).
                            I downloaded Spotify (<i>Yeah, I'm an Apple Music enthusiast</i>) and decided to see if I
                            got
                            different numbers than these reports. To do this, I listened to 41 total songs in a row and
                            tracked how often an ad break came on (<i>Trust me, this experiment was as gruelling as it
                                sounds</i>). Here were my results:</p>

                        <figure><img
                                src="https://andrewkirrane.github.io/Portfolio/image/spotify-MAU-viz/experiment.png" />
                        </figure>

                        <p>Out of 41 songs listened to, there were 9 ad breaks. That roughly translates to an ad break
                            every 4.6
                            songs. When you extrapolate this over an entire hour, with an average song time of 3 minutes
                            (<i>This is for you pop, hip hop, and country fans, not the jazz and classical lovers</i>),
                            the total number of ad breaks based on the 2022 reports would be 8, while my data showed a
                            respectable 4.39, a 35% reduction. If these trends hold true over a long period of time for
                            each user and advertisers know this, it's no wonder that some of them pulled back or quit
                            Spotify advertising entirely.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Impacts on the Business Model</strong></p>

                        <p>This brings me to my last question, <strong>is the decrease in ad revenue hurting Spotify a
                                lot?</strong> The answer here isn't just a simple yes or no, but I do believe that it leans more
                            on the no side. Here is their ad revenue side-by-side with their gross profits:</p>

                        <figure><img
                                src="https://andrewkirrane.github.io/Portfolio/image/spotify-MAU-viz/ad-revenue-vs-profits.png" />
                        </figure>

                        <p>Although there is a decline in profit during Q1 2023, the addition of lower marketing
                            spending and most likely some other costs cut throughout the business resulted in a much more gradual decline. I think that this bodes well for their platform and shows that there is
                            a legitament path forward for them to develop a phenominal free service that could take
                            market space from companies like Pandora and Soundcloud. If they can grow the free user base
                            enough, advertisers will have to continue to invest in their service and it would be a win-win for
                            everyone.</p>
